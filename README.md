## üß† Project Overview

MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for efficiency on resource-constrained devices. This project aims to implement a scaled-down version of the MobileNet architecture for classification tasks, targeting the DE0-Nano FPGA platform.

Key features:
- Optimized Verilog modules for CNN components
- Focus on low memory usage and efficient processing
- Compatible with SDRAM-based buffering
- Suitable for real-time image input via camera (e.g., OV7670)

## üöÄ Goals

- Understand and apply deep learning architecture on hardware
- Design and simulate CNN modules in Verilog
- Synthesize and deploy MobileNet modules to FPGA
- Build a foundation for FPGA-based edge AI solutions
- Make a application to detect traffic jam

## üìå Notes

- This project was completed for educational and research purposes.
- All source code is open source.
